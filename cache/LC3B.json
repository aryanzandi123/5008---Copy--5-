It cleaves the amide bond between LC3B-II and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on autophagosomal membranes.",

Exposing the C-terminal glycine is an absolute requirement for LC3B-I to be recognized and activated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7, thereby priming it for its role in autophagy.; This delipidation activity releases LC3B from the membrane, recycling it back into the cytosolic pool of LC3B-I.

Alfy interacts with Atg5, p62, and the Atg8 homolog GABARAP and localizes to protein aggregates together with these proteins. Depletion of Alfy impairs the delivery of aggregated proteins to autophagosomes, whereas overexpression of Alfy is sufficient to target cytosolic proteins for autophagic degradation. Our results suggest that Alfy acts as a scaffold protein that directs aggregated proteins to the autophagic machinery."
