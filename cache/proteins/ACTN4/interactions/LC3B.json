The interaction is indirect. ACTN4, an actin-bundling protein, is proposed to structure the actin cytoskeleton, creating a scaffold that facilitates the spatial organization of autophagy. It is a component of p62/SQSTM1-containing aggregates, and p62 acts as the direct bridge to LC3B. The primary role of ACTN4 is not direct binding to LC3B but organizing the cytoskeletal environment where autophagosome formation occurs.",
