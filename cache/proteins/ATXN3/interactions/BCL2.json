Therefore, when ATXN3 inhibits Parkin's E3 ligase activity, it leads to DECREASED mono-ubiquitination and subsequent DESTABILIZATION of BCL2, which relieves the inhibition on Beclin-1 and PROMOTES autophagy. The final outcome in the input is correct, but the mechanistic explanation of the intermediate step is reversed.",
