While mutant ATXN3 does abnormally interact with CCT5, primary literature emphasizes that this altered interaction leads to a loss or weakening of association within larger functional complexes, rather than a simple inhibitory binding event that blocks folding. This disruption is linked to downstream consequences like impaired mitochondrial transport, rather than a directly proven global inhibition of the CCT/TRiC's protein folding machinery. The interaction appears to be part of a broader disruption of protein complex integrity.",
