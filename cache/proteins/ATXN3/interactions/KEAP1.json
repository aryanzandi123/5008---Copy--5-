Primary literature demonstrates the opposite: ATXN3 is required to maintain normal KEAP1 levels. Loss of ATXN3 leads to a *decrease* in KEAP1. Therefore, under normal physiological conditions, ATXN3 sustains the level of KEAP1, which is the primary negative regulator of NRF2. This results in an indirect *inhibition* or suppression of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, not its activation.",
