The literature shows that under amino acid starvation, ATXN3 is recruited to the lysosome where it deubiquitinates RHEB, maintaining it in a hypo-ubiquitinated, inactive state, thus inhibiting mTORC1. However, upon amino acid stimulation, ATXN3 is released from the lysosome, allowing RHEB to become poly-ubiquitinated. This poly-ubiquitination is a *positive signal* that enhances RHEB's binding to and activation of mTORC1. Therefore, ATXN3's deubiquitinase activity on RHEB is inhibitory to the mTORC1 pathway.",
