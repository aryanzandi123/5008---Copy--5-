PUM1 is an RNA-binding protein that binds to the 3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR) of ATXN3 mRNA, not to the ATXN3 protein. This binding represses the translation of ATXN3 mRNA. Therefore, PUM1 is an upstream negative regulator of ATXN3 protein expression. Reduced PUM1 activity leads to increased ATXN3 protein levels, which exacerbates pathology in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3). The arrow should point from PUM1 to ATXN3 and be labeled 'inhibits'.",
