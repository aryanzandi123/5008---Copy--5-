This action stabilizes the presence of MDC1 on the chromatin, prolonging its dwell time and ensuring the robust recruitment of downstream DNA repair factors like RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1, and BRCA1. This balanced opposition between ATXN3 and RNF4 is critical for consolidating the DNA damage signal and promoting efficient repair.",
