This leads to a functional deficit of CaMKII, likely through sequestration or disruption of the complex, which impairs its downstream signaling. The input's claim of 'inhibition' is contextually correct as a loss-of-function but the mechanism is pathological association, not direct enzymatic inhibition.",
