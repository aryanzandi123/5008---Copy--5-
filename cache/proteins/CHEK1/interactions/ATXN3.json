      "cellular_process": "ATXN3 functions as a deubiquitinase (DUB) for the checkpoint kinase CHEK1 (Chk1). Under normal conditions and during the initial DNA damage response, ATXN3 directly binds to CHEK1 and removes polyubiquitin chains that are added by E3 ligase complexes, specifically DDB1/CUL4A and FBXO6/CUL1. This action protects CHEK1 from being targeted for degradation by the proteasome.",

This stabilization significantly prolongs the half-life of CHEK1, ensuring that a sufficient pool of the kinase is available to activate and sustain DNA damage checkpoint signaling, thereby promoting genome integrity.",

        "ATXN3 binds to CHEK1 → ATXN3 removes polyubiquitin chains from CHEK1, antagonizing E3 ligases DDB1/CUL4A and FBXO6/CUL1 → Proteasomal degradation of CHEK1 is prevented → CHEK1 protein half-life is prolonged and steady-state levels are maintained → Robust G2/M DNA damage checkpoint signaling is enabled → Cell survival is increased upon genotoxic stress."
