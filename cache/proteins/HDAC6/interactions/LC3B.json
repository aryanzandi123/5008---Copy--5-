It acts as a cargo receptor for ubiquitinated protein aggregates and facilitates their transport to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Furthermore, it promotes the maturation and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes through enzymatic and scaffolding functions.",

It then links this cargo to the dynein motor protein complex, facilitating retrograde transport along microtubules to form an aggresome. Additionally, HDAC6 deacetylates LC3-II, which promotes autophagic flux, and it deacetylates cortactin to assemble an F-actin network required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion during the clearance of protein aggregates.",
