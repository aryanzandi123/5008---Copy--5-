        "Mutant HTT impairs ATXN3 and PNKP activity within the complex → Decreased ATXN3 activity leads to increased ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CBP → Disrupted transcription and DNA repair → Accumulation of DNA strand breaks and activation of pro-apoptotic DNA damage response pathways."
