When a mitochondrion is damaged, PINK1 import is halted, leading to its accumulation on the OMM. Accumulated PINK1 autophosphorylates and then phosphorylates ubiquitin (at Ser65) on OMM proteins and the E3 ligase Parkin. Activated Parkin further ubiquitinates OMM proteins, creating a 'signal' that is recognized by autophagy receptors like OPTN and NDP52. These receptors then bind to LC3B on the phagophore, targeting the damaged mitochondrion for engulfment.",
