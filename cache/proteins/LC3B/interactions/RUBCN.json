        "RUBCN is recruited to Rab7-positive late endosomes/lysosomes → RUBCN associates with the Beclin-1-UVRAG-PI3KC3 complex → The RUBCN-containing complex inhibits the tethering activity of the HOPS complex → HOPS fails to mediate the assembly of the trans-SNARE complex between the autophagosome and lysosome → Membrane fusion is blocked → Autophagic flux is suppressed."
