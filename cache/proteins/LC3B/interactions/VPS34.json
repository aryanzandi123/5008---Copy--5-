In the context of autophagy initiation, VPS34 forms 'Complex I' along with its regulatory partners Beclin-1, VPS15, and the autophagy-specific subunit ATG14L. This complex is activated at the phagophore nucleation site (e.g., the ER) following upstream signaling events like the release of the complex mediated by AMBRA1.",

This localized enrichment of PI(3)P acts as a crucial docking site for proteins containing PI(3)P-binding domains (like FYVE or PX domains), most notably the WIPI family of proteins (e.g., WIPI2). The recruitment of these effectors is the foundational step that links upstream signaling to the assembly of the LC3B conjugation machinery.",
