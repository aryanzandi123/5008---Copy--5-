The interaction is isoform-specific, and its primary effect is the inhibition of ATXN3's enzymatic activity, not its deubiquitination of PML. ATXN3 is recruited to PML Nuclear Bodies (NBs) by the PML-II isoform. This interaction does not primarily regulate PML stability via deubiquitination but instead inhibits the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of ATXN3 itself. This suggests PML-II acts as a negative regulator of ATXN3, which in turn would affect the ubiquitination status of other ATXN3 substrates.",
