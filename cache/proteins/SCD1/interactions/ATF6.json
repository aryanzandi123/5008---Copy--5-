The transcriptional regulation of SCD1 (Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) during ER stress is primarily mediated by the IRE1 branch of the UPR. Activated IRE1 splices XBP1 mRNA to produce the potent transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s, in turn, can activate the expression of SREBP1 (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1), which is the master transcriptional regulator of lipogenic genes, including SCD1. ATF6's role in lipid metabolism is complex and appears more focused on fatty acid oxidation in the liver, rather than direct activation of SCD1.",
